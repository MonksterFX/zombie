# zombie - a battery watch

What is zombie? Zombie is a macOS menu bar app which watches the battery level. If the battery level goes below a threshold, a visual indication will be shown. In this time the app monitors the battery closely.

Why we need this? You know living on the edge with your battery on macOS can be a thing. You start your Meeting or are in the flow an forgot about the warning of low battery.

On Windows you will get warned a second time, some seconds before the device is going to shuting down because of low battery. In macOS this is not the case. It will just shutdown.

# How it works?

Its a simple overlay which draws a border to the current main screen, which grows the lower your battery gets.

# Disclaimer

I'm not a Swift/SwiftUI/Apple Professional. This is a current prototype which has (let phrase it like this) room to improve :)

Feel free to help out...
